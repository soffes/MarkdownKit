# MarkdownKit

Swift wrapper for [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark). This is using an adapted version of [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm).

This was abstracted from one of the many unreleased rewrites of [Whiskey](https://usewhiskey.com) and can be used for text highlighting for Markdown.
